FOREWORD

This Indian Standard which is identical with ISO 6954:2000 `Mechanical vibration -- Guidelines for the measurement, reporting and evaluation of vibration with regard to habitability on passenger and merchant ships' issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendation of the Mechanical Vibration and Shock Sectional Committee and approval of the Mechanical Engineering Division Council. This standard supersedes IS 14733 : 1999 `Mechanical overall evaluation of vibration in merchant ships'. vibration and shock -- Guidelines for the

The text of ISO Standard has been approved as suitable for publication as an Indian Standard without deviations. Certain terminology and conventions are, however, not identical to those used in Indian Standards. Attention is particularly drawn to the following:

a) Wherever the words `International Standard' appear referring to this standard, they should
be read as `Indian Standard'. b) Comma (,) has been used as a decimal marker in the International Standards, Indian Standards, the current practice is to use a point (.) as the decimal marker. while in

In this adopted standard, reference appears to certain International Standards for which Indian Standards also exist. The corresponding Indian Standards, which are to be substituted in their respective places, are listed below along with their degree of equivalence for the editions indicated:

3.1 General requirements

Measurements in accordance with this International Standard maybe carried out using different types of measuring and recording equipment, e.g. instruments of analog, digital, spectral or time-based type. The measuring instrumentation shall meet the requirements of ISO 8041. It is acceptable to use instruments manufactured in accordance with ISO 8041 that have trequency 80 Hz provided that the filter characteristics comply with ISO 2631-2 (see annex A). The compliance of the instrumentation system with the requirements second year. The date of the last verification shall be recorded. indications above

of ISO 8041 shall be verified at least every

Each channel of the instrumentation shall be checked after installation to ensure proper functioning. the instrumentation shall be checked before and after the measurements.

Measurement

conditions

Measurement data shall be obtained, in the first instance, during the acceptance or performance trial of the ship. The collection of consistent and accurate vibration data requires the following uniform and favorable measurement conditions: a) b) c) d) e) free-route constant test on a straight course;') representative engine output;

sea state 3 or less; full immersion of the propeller;

water depth not less than five times the draught of the ship. from the above measurement conditions shall be clearly stated in the test report.

NOTE One-third-octave band values of the combined frequency weighting curve and a graphical presentation are given in annex A for information. The frequency range to be evaluated is 1 Hz to 80 Hz. components exist in the range below 2 Hz,

The measurement duration shall beat least 1 min. If significant frequency a measurement duration of at least 2 min is required.

The result of each measurement shall be the overall frequency-weighted r.m.s. value as defined for acceleration in ISO 2631-1:1997, 6.4.2. A similar procedure is applicable for the frequency weighting of velocity spectra. The highest value in any direction shall be used for the evaluation of habitability, using the guidance given in clause 7. If further data analysis is required following the measurement analysis as described above, the measurement data should be recorded with an electronic system which produces permanent records, e.g. on magnetic tape or computer disk. 1) Free route is the condition maintained when the ship is proceeding at constant speed and course with rudder angles restricted to less than 2° port and 2° starboard.

It is recommended that the classification to be applied to the various areas of a ship be agreed interested parties (e.g. shipbuilder and shipowner) prior to any assessment of the habitability.

Table 1 contains guidelines for the values above which adverse comments are probable, and values below which adverse comments are not probable. The values are expressed in terms of the overall frequency-weighted r.m.s. acceleration (mm/sz) and overall frequency-weighted r.m.s. velocity (mm/s) in the range 1 Hz to 80 Hz. The human sensitivity curve on which the frequency-weighting curves are based is shown for deeper understanding in annex B.
